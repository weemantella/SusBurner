# SusBurner

A scaled down StealthBurner mixed with FilamATrix, brings you SusBurner, a PFA toolhead.

### Work in Progress

This is very much a work in progress toolhead. Don't complain when thing inevitably change and are no longer compatible.

- 80% scaled Stealthburner that fit's the tiny Vorons like the V0 (more information below)
- 4020 for Part-cooling (like from the Afterburner) and 3007 for Hotend-cooling
- CW2 extruder with adapted internals to fir the small formfactor
- Full size nozzle LEDs - same as for his big brother (Logo LED is on the TO-Do)
- Filament cutter based on standard FilamATrix/Filametrix cutters
- Pre-extruder sensor
